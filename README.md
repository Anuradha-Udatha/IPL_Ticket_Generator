# IPL_Ticket_Generator
This is a project built in C++, generates an 'IPL 2021 Ticket .txt' file which contains the user data like the Name of the user, and Teams playing in that match, the timing of the match. I have globally declared the variables for storing teams and venues. This program uses mainly conditional statements and file handling techniques.
