This is a project built in C++, generates an 'IPL 2021 Ticket .txt' file which contains the user data like the Name of the user, and Teams playing in that match, the timing of the match.

I have globally declared the variables for storing teams and venues. This program uses mainly conditional statements and file handling techniques in the program.

I have written some other functions other than the main function.

1. setcolorandbackground(): This is used to set the colour and background of the text on the output console.

2. title(): This prints the title of the program 'IPL Ticket Booking' on the top of the console.

3. print_mainmenu(): This function prints the contents of the main menu on the screen.

4. print_teams(): This function prints the teams that will be participating in IPL.

5. print_venue(): This function prints the venues that IPL will be taking place.

6. print_matches(): This is used to print all the matches that will be taking place in IPL.

7. print_ticket(): This generates a text file i.e., 'IPL 2021 Ticket.txt' which has the user name and the details of the match.
